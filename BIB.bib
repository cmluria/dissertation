              aquatic $\alpha$-Proteobacteria known as ``SAR11'', are adapted
              to nutrient-poor environments such as the surface waters of the
              open ocean. Unknown prior to 1990, uncultured until 2002, members
              of the SAR11 clade can now be cultured in artificial, defined
              media to densities three orders of magnitude higher than in
              unamended natural media. Cultivation in natural and defined media
              has confirmed genomic and metagenomic predictions such as an
              inability to reduce sulfate to sulfide, a requirement for
              pyruvate, an ability to oxidize a wide variety of methylated and
              one-carbon compounds for energy, and an unusual form of
              conditional glycine auxotrophy. Here we describe the metabolism
              of the SAR11 type strain Candidatus ``Pelagibacter ubique'' str.
              HTCC1062, as revealed by genome-assisted studies of laboratory
              cultures. We also describe the discovery of SAR11 and field
              studies that have been done on natural populations.},

              had resulted in reduced salinity. The region involved was one of

              growth, accumulation, or both. Epontic algae released from

	Abstract = {Microbial communities are at the heart of all ecosystems, and yet
              microbial community behavior in disturbed environments remains
              difficult to measure and predict. Understanding the drivers of
              microbial community stability, including resistance
              (insensitivity to disturbance) and resilience (the rate of
              recovery after disturbance) is important for predicting community
              response to disturbance. Here, we provide an overview of the
              concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial
              communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are
              useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether
              general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we
              next examine representative studies from the literature that
              investigated community responses to press (long-term) and pulse
              (short-term) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we
              discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of
              microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may
              govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts
              about the unique insights that systems perspectives - informed by
              meta-omics data - may provide about microbial community
              stability.},

	Abstract = {Although open ocean time-series sites have been areas of
              microbial research for years, relatively little is known about
              the population dynamics of bacterioplankton communities in the
              coastal ocean on kilometer spatial and seasonal temporal scales.
              To gain a better understanding of microbial community
              variability, monthly samples of bacterial biomass were collected
              in 1995-1996 along a 34-km transect near the Long-Term Ecosystem
              Observatory (LEO-15) off the New Jersey coast. Surface and bottom
              sampling was performed at seven stations along a transect line
              with depths ranging from 1 to 35 m (n=178). Microbial populations
              were fingerprinted using ribosomal 16S rRNA genes and terminal
              restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results from
              cluster analysis revealed distinct temporal patterns among the
              bacterioplankton communities in the Mid-Atlantic Bight rather
              than grouping by sample location or depth. Principal components
              analysis models supported the temporal patterns. In addition,
              partial least squares regression modeling could not discern a
              significant correlation from traditional oceanographic physical
              and phytoplankton nutrient parameters on overall bacterial
              community variability patterns at LEO-15. These results suggest
              factors not traditionally measured during oceanographic studies
              are structuring coastal microbial communities.},

	Abstract = {Very few marine microbial communities are well characterized even
              with the weight of research effort presently devoted to it. Only
              a small proportion of this effort has been aimed at investigating
              temporal community structure. Here we present the first report of
              the application of high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate
              intra-annual bacterial community structure. Microbial diversity
              was determined for 12 time points at the surface of the L4
              sampling site in the Western English Channel. This was performed
              over 11 months during 2007. A total of 182 560 sequences from the
              V6 hyper-variable region of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene
              (16S rRNA) were obtained; there were between 11 327 and 17 339
              reads per sample. Approximately 7000 genera were identified, with
              one in every 25 reads being attributed to a new genus; yet this
              level of sampling far from exhausted the total diversity present
              at any one time point. The total data set contained 17 673 unique
              sequences. Only 93 (0.5\%) were found at all time points, yet
              these few lineages comprised 50\% of the total reads sequenced.
              The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (50\% of all
              sequenced reads), while the SAR11 clade comprised 21\% of the
              ubiquitous reads and approximately 12\% of the total sequenced
              reads. In contrast, 78\% of all operational taxonomic units were
              only found at one time point and 67\% were only found once,
              evidence of a large and transient rare assemblage. This time
              series shows evidence of seasonally structured community
              diversity. There is also evidence for seasonal succession,
              primarily reflecting changes among dominant taxa. These changes
              in structure were significantly correlated to a combination of
              temperature, phosphate and silicate concentrations.},

              binning of sequences into previously described and highly
              resolved phylogenetic groups (tribes), their temporal dynamics
              revealed extensive synchrony and associations with seasonal
              events such as ice coverage, ice-off, mixing and phytoplankton
              blooms. Coupling between closely and distantly related tribes was
              resolved by time-dependent rank correlations, suggesting
              ecological coherence that was often dependent on taxonomic
              relatedness. Association networks with the abundant freshwater
              Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in focus revealed complex
              interdependencies within bacterioplankton communities and
              contrasting linkages to environmental conditions. Accordingly,
              unique ecological features can be inferred for each tribe and
              reveal the natural history of abundant cultured and uncultured
              freshwater bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Time-series observations form a critical element of oceanography.
              New interdisciplinary efforts launched in the past two decades
              complement the few earlier, longer-running time series to build a
              better, though still poorly resolved, picture of lower-frequency
              ocean variability, the climate processes that drive variability,
              and the implications for food web dynamics, carbon storage, and
              climate feedbacks. Time series also enlarge our understanding of
              ecological processes and are integral for improving models of
              physical-biogeochemical-ecological ocean dynamics. The major
              time-series observatories go well beyond simple monitoring of
              core ocean properties, although that important activity forms the
              critical center of all time-series efforts. Modern ocean time
              series have major process and experimental components, entrain
              ancillary programs, and have integrated modeling programs for
              deriving a better understanding of the observations and the
              changing, three-dimensional ocean in which the observatories are
              embedded.},

	Abstract = {Cigarette smokers have an increased risk of infectious diseases
              involving the respiratory tract. Some effects of smoking on
              specific respiratory tract bacteria have been described, but the
              consequences for global airway microbial community composition
              have not been determined. Here, we used culture-independent
              high-density sequencing to analyze the microbiota from the right
              and left nasopharynx and oropharynx of 29 smoking and 33
              nonsmoking healthy asymptomatic adults to assess microbial
              composition and effects of cigarette smoking. Bacterial
              communities were profiled using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S
              sequence tags (803,391 total reads), aligned to 16S rRNA
              databases, and communities compared using the UniFrac distance
              metric. A Random Forest machine-learning algorithm was used to
              predict smoking status and identify taxa that best distinguished
              between smokers and nonsmokers. Community composition was
              primarily determined by airway site, with individuals exhibiting
              minimal side-of-body or temporal variation. Within airway
              habitats, microbiota from smokers were significantly more diverse
              than nonsmokers and clustered separately. The distributions of
              several genera were systematically altered by smoking in both the
              oro- and nasopharynx, and there was an enrichment of anaerobic
              lineages associated with periodontal disease in the oropharynx.
              These results indicate that distinct regions of the human upper
              respiratory tract contain characteristic microbial communities
              that exhibit disordered patterns in cigarette smokers, both in
              individual components and global structure, which may contribute
              to the prevalence of respiratory tract complications in this
              population.},

	Abstract = {The understanding of marine microbial ecology and metabolism has been hampered by the paucity of sequenced reference genomes. To this end, we report the sequencing of 137 diverse marine isolates collected from around the world. We analysed these sequences, along with previously published marine prokaryotic genomes, in the context of marine metagenomic data, to gain insights into the ecology of the surface ocean prokaryotic picoplankton (0.1-3.0 mum size range). The results suggest that the sequenced genomes define two microbial groups: one composed of only a few taxa that are nearly always abundant in picoplanktonic communities, and the other consisting of many microbial taxa that are rarely abundant. The genomic content of the second group suggests that these microbes are capable of slow growth and survival in energy-limited environments, and rapid growth in energy-rich environments. By contrast, the abundant and cosmopolitan picoplanktonic prokaryotes for which there is genomic representation have smaller genomes, are probably capable of only slow growth and seem to be relatively unable to sense or rapidly acclimate to energy-rich conditions. Their genomic features also lead us to propose that one method used to avoid predation by viruses and/or bacterivores is by means of slow growth and the maintenance of low biomass.},

	Abstract = {The northwestern Sargasso Sea undergoes annual cycles of
              productivity with increased production in spring corresponding to
              periods of upwelling, and oligotrophy in summer and autumn, when
              the water column becomes highly stratified. The biological
              productivity of this region is reduced during stratified periods
              as a result of low concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in
              the euphotic zone. To better understand the mechanisms of
              microbial survival in this oligotrophic environment, we used
              capillary liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry to
              detect microbial proteins in surface samples collected in
              September 2005. A total of 2215 peptides that mapped to 236 SAR11
              proteins, 1911 peptides that mapped to 402 Prochlorococcus
              proteins and 2407 peptides that mapped to 404 Synechococcus
              proteins were detected. Mass spectra from SAR11 periplasmic
              substrate-binding proteins accounted for a disproportionately
              large fraction of the peptides detected, consistent with
              observations that these extremely small cells devote a large
              proportion of their volume to periplasm. Abundances were highest
              for periplasmic substrate-binding proteins for phosphate, amino
              acids, phosphonate, sugars and spermidine. Proteins implicated in
              the prevention of oxidative damage and protein refolding were
              also abundant. Our findings support the view that competition for
              multiple nutrients in oligotrophic systems is extreme, but
              nutrient flux is sufficient to sustain microbial community
              activity.},

	Abstract = {Bacteroidetes are widespread in marine systems where they play a
              crucial role in organic matter degradation. Whole genome analysis
              of several strains has revealed a broad glycolytic and
              proteolytic potential. In this study, we used a targeted
              metagenomic approach to investigate the degradation capabilities
              of distinct Bacteroidetes clades from two contrasting regions of
              the North Atlantic Ocean, the Polar Biome (BPLR) and the North
              Atlantic Subtropical (NAST). We present here the analysis of 76
              Bacteroidetes fosmids, of which 28 encode the 16S rRNA gene as
              phylogenetic marker, and their comparison to complete
              Bacteroidetes genomes. Almost all of the 16S rRNA harbouring
              fosmids belonged to clades that we previously identified in BPLR
              and NAST. The majority of sequenced fosmids could be assigned to
              Bacteroidetes affiliated with the class Flavobacteria. We also
              present novel genomic information on the classes Cytophagia and
              Sphingobacteria, suggesting a capability of the latter for
              attachment to algal surfaces. In our fosmid set we identified a
              larger potential for polysaccharide degradation and cell surface
              attachment in the phytoplankton-rich BPLR. Particularly, two
              flavobacterial fosmids, one affiliated with the genus
              Polaribacter, showed a whole armoury of enzymes that likely
              function in degradation of sulfated polysaccharides known to be
              major constituents of phytoplankton cell walls. Genes involved in
              protein and peptidoglycan degradation, although present in both
              fosmid sets, seemed to have a slight preponderance in NAST. This
              study provides support for the hypothesis of a distinct

              response to North Sea spring phytoplankton blooms. We analyzed
              two respective Polaribacter species by whole genome sequencing,
              comparative genomics, substrate tests and proteomics. Both can
              degrade algal polysaccharides but occupy distinct niches. The
              liquid culture isolate Polaribacter sp. strain Hel1\_33\_49 has a
              3.0-Mbp genome with an overall peptidase:CAZyme ratio of 1.37,
              four putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) and features
              proteorhodopsin, whereas the agar plate isolate Polaribacter sp.
              strain Hel1\_85 has a 3.9-Mbp genome with an even
              peptidase:CAZyme ratio, eight PULs, a mannitol dehydrogenase for
              decomposing algal mannitol-capped polysaccharides but no
              proteorhodopsin. Unlike other sequenced Polaribacter species,
              both isolates have larger sulfatase-rich PULs, supporting earlier
              assumptions that Polaribacter take part in the decomposition of
              sulfated polysaccharides. Both strains grow on algal laminarin
              and the sulfated polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate. For strain
              Hel1\_33\_49, we identified by proteomics (i) a laminarin-induced
              PUL, (ii) chondroitin sulfate-induced CAZymes and (iii) a
              chondroitin-induced operon that likely enables chondroitin
              sulfate recognition. These and other data suggest that strain
              Hel1\_33\_49 is a planktonic flavobacterium feeding on proteins
              and a small subset of algal polysaccharides, while the more
              versatile strain Hel1\_85 can decompose a broader spectrum of
              polysaccharides and likely associates with algae.},

              spring. We investigated the bacterioplankton response to a diatom
              bloom in the North Sea and observed a dynamic succession of
              populations at genus-level resolution. Taxonomically distinct
              expressions of carbohydrate-active enzymes (transporters; in
              particular, TonB-dependent transporters) and phosphate
              acquisition strategies were found, indicating that distinct
              populations of Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and
              Alphaproteobacteria are specialized for successive decomposition
              of algal-derived organic matter. Our results suggest that algal
              substrate availability provided a series of ecological niches in
              which specialized populations could bloom. This reveals how
              planktonic species, despite their seemingly homogeneous habitat,

              German Bight towards the end of a diatom-dominated spring
              phytoplankton bloom revealed pronounced successions of distinct
              bacterial clades. A combination of metagenomics and
              metaproteomics indicated that these clades had distinct substrate
              spectra and consumed different algal substrates. In this study we
              re-analyzed samples from the initial study by total community RNA
              (metatranscriptomics) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. This
              complementary approach provided new insights into the community
              composition and expressed genes as well as the assessment of
              metabolic activity levels of distinct clades. Flavobacteria
              (genera Ulvibacter, Formosa, and Polaribacter),

              Gammaproteobacteria (genus Reinekea and SAR92 clade) were the

              major algal polymer degraders, whereas Rhodobacteraceae and
              Reinekea spp. exhibited less specialized substrate spectra. In
              addition, we found that members of the Rhodobacteraceae and SAR92

	Abstract = {The results of empirical studies have revealed links between
              phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, such as the frequent
              correlation between chlorophyll a and bulk bacterial abundance
              and production. Nevertheless, little is known about possible
              links at the level of specific taxonomic groups. To investigate
              this issue, seawater microcosm experiments were performed in the
              northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Turbulence was used as a
              noninvasive means to induce phytoplankton blooms dominated by
              different algae. Microcosms exposed to turbulence became
              dominated by diatoms, while small phytoflagellates gained
              importance under still conditions. Denaturing gradient gel
              electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that
              changes in phytoplankton community composition were followed by
              shifts in bacterioplankton community composition, both as changes
              in the presence or absence of distinct bacterial phylotypes and
              as differences in the relative abundance of ubiquitous
              phylotypes. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that four Roseobacter
              phylotypes were present in all microcosms. The microcosms with a
              higher proportion of phytoflagellates were characterized by four
              phylotypes of the Bacteroidetes phylum: two affiliated with the
              family Cryomorphaceae and two with the family Flavobacteriaceae.
              Two other Flavobacteriaceae phylotypes were characteristic of the
              diatom-dominated microcosms, together with one
              Alphaproteobacteria phylotype (Roseobacter) and one
              Gammaproteobacteria phylotype (Methylophaga). Phylogenetic
              analyses of published Bacteroidetes 16S rRNA gene sequences
              confirmed that members of the Flavobacteriaceae are remarkably
              responsive to phytoplankton blooms, indicating these bacteria
              could be particularly important in the processing of organic
              matter during such events. Our data suggest that quantitative and
              qualitative differences in phytoplankton species composition may
              lead to pronounced differences in bacterioplankton species

              deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and
              fluorescent lectin binding analysis (FLBA) was used to identify
              and map glycoconjugates involved in the specific interactions of
              Bacteroidetes and diatoms, as well as detritus, at the coastal
              marine site Helgoland Roads (German Bight, North Sea). The study

              polymeric substances (EPS) of Bacteroidetes for cell attachment
              and that of glycoconjugates on diatoms with respect to binding
              sites for Bacteroidetes. Members of the clades Polaribacter and
              Ulvibacter were shown to form microcolonies within aggregates for

              Polaribacter spp. was shown to bind specifically to the setae of

              Peninsula (WAP) region of the Southern Ocean has affected
              multiple trophic levels, yet viral influences on microbial
              processes and ecosystem function remain understudied in the
              Southern Ocean. Here we use cultivation-independent quantitative
              ecological and metagenomic assays, combined with new comparative
              bioinformatic techniques, to investigate double-stranded DNA
              viruses during the WAP spring-summer transition. This study
              demonstrates that (i) temperate viruses dominate this region,
              switching from lysogeny to lytic replication as bacterial
              production increases, and (ii) Southern Ocean viral assemblages
              are genetically distinct from lower-latitude assemblages,
              primarily driven by this temperate viral dominance. This new
              information suggests fundamentally different virus-host
              interactions in polar environments, where intense seasonal
              changes in bacterial production select for temperate viruses
              because of increased fitness imparted by the ability to switch
              replication strategies in response to resource availability.
              Further, temperate viral dominance may provide mechanisms (for
              example, bacterial mortality resulting from prophage induction)
              that help explain observed temporal delays between, and lower
              ratios of, bacterial and primary production in polar versus
              lower-latitude marine ecosystems. Together these results suggest

              mapped at a global scale. Although current community surveys are
              way too sparse to map global diversity patterns directly, there
              is now sufficient data to fit accurate models of how bacterial
              distributions vary across different environments and to make
              global scale maps from these models. We apply this approach to
              map the global distributions of bacteria in marine surface
              waters. Our spatially and temporally explicit predictions suggest
              that bacterial diversity peaks in temperate latitudes across the
              world's oceans. These global peaks are seasonal, occurring 6
              months apart in the two hemispheres, in the boreal and austral

              seasonally consistent diversity patterns observed for most

              water bacteria are particularly diverse in regions of high human
              environmental impacts on the oceans. Our maps provide the first

              sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different
              types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics,
              multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the
              increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued,
              project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these
              analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers
              to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite
              tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already
              implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited
              support for high throughput microbiome census data. RESULTS: Here
              we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the
              object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census
              data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common
              formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include
              calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table
              comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac,
              ordination methods, and production of publication-quality
              graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and
              modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to
              phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a
              large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the
              use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice
              common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly
              parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of

              relationship in the context of natural iron fertilization,
              bacterial diversity and activity was investigated in the bloom
              and in the adjacent HNLC region by 16S rDNA clone libraries and
              by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Both
              libraries were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria,
              Gammaproteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides
              group. Cluster analysis at 99\% sequence similarity yielded
              several microdiverse clusters and revealed striking differences
              between the two libraries. In the bloom, the dominant operational
              taxonomic units (OTUs) were the Roseobacter NAC11-7 cluster,
              SAR92 and a Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides cluster related
              to the agg58 group, whereas in the HNLC region, SAR11,
              Roseobacter RCA and Polaribacter dominated. SSCP analysis of 16S
              rDNA and 16S rRNA revealed contrasting dynamics of three
              different Roseobacter OTUs. Roseobacter NAC11-7 and NAC11-6 had
              higher relative abundances and activities in the bloom compared
              with the HNLC site and NAC11-6 was only detected at the decline
              of the bloom concomitant with a shift in phytoplankton composi
              tion. In contrast, Roseobacter RCA was relatively abundant and
              active both inside and outside of the bloom. These results
              suggest that the different OTUs within the Roseobacter group
              represent functional groups that each play an important role in
              the cycling of carbon.},

              temperate to (sub)polar oceans, constituting up to 35\% of total
              bacterioplankton. The genome analysis of the first described
              species of the RCA cluster, Planktomarina temperata RCA23,
              revealed that this phylogenetic lineage is deeply branching
              within the Roseobacter clade. It shares not >65.7\% of homologous
              genes with any other organism of this clade. The genome is the
              smallest of all closed genomes of the Roseobacter clade, exhibits
              various features of genome streamlining and encompasses genes for
              aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis (AAP) and CO oxidation. In

              (mean 18.5\%) of the active bacterioplankton. A
              metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the genome of P.

              variations during day and night. The genome of P. temperata RCA23

              seasonally hypoxic basin in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (Bedford
              Basin). From winter to spring, we observed a seasonal increase in
              high-affinity membrane transport proteins involved in scavenging
              of organic substrates; Rhodobacterales transporters were strongly
              associated with the spring phytoplankton bloom, whereas SAR11
              transporters were abundant in the underlying waters. A diverse
              array of transporters for organic compounds were similar to the
              SAR324 clade, revealing an active heterotrophic lifestyle in
              coastal waters. Proteins involved in methanol oxidation (from the
              OM43 clade) and carbon monoxide (from a wide variety of bacteria)
              were identified throughout Bedford Basin. Metabolic niche
              partitioning between the SUP05 and ARCTIC96BD-19 clades, which
              together comprise the Gamma-proteobacterial sulfur oxidizers
              group was apparent. ARCTIC96BD-19 proteins involved in the
              transport of organic compounds indicated that in productive
              coastal waters this lineage tends toward a heterotrophic
              metabolism. In contrast, the identification of sulfur oxidation
              proteins from SUP05 indicated the use of reduced sulfur as an
              energy source in hypoxic bottom water. We identified an abundance
              of Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota proteins in the hypoxic deep
              layer, including proteins for nitrification and carbon fixation.
              No transporters for organic compounds were detected among the
              thaumarchaeal proteins, suggesting a reliance on autotrophic
              carbon assimilation. In summary, our analyses revealed the

              March 1998. Organic- and inorganic-nutrient enrichment
              experiments were performed between 42 degrees S and 55 degrees S
              along 141 degrees E. Bacterial abundance, mean cell volume, and
              [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]leucine incorporation were measured
              during 4- to 5-day incubations. Bacterial biomass, production,
              and rates of growth all responded to organic enrichments in three
              of the four experiments. These results indicate that bacterial
              growth was constrained primarily by the availability of dissolved
              organic matter. Bacterial growth in the subtropical front,
              subantarctic zone, and subantarctic front responded most
              favorably to additions of dissolved free amino acids or glucose
              plus ammonium. Bacterial growth in these regions may be limited
              by input of both organic matter and reduced nitrogen. Unlike
              similar experimental results in other HNLC regions (subarctic and
              equatorial Pacific), growth stimulation of bacteria in the
              Southern Ocean resulted in significant biomass accumulation,
              apparently by stimulating bacterial growth in excess of removal
              processes. Bacterial growth was relatively unchanged by additions
              of iron alone; however, additions of glucose plus iron resulted
              in substantial increases in rates of bacterial growth and biomass
              accumulation. These results imply that bacterial growth
              efficiency and nitrogen utilization may be partly constrained by
              iron availability in the HNLC Southern Ocean.},

              polynyas are often dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis

              resident microbial food web. Yet, little is known about how
              Phaeocystis blooms shape bacterial community structures and
              carbon fluxes in these systems. We identified the bacterial
              communities that accompanied a Phaeocystis bloom in the Amundsen
              Sea polynya during the austral summers of 2007-2008 and
              2010-2011. These communities are distinct from those determined
              for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and off the Palmer
              Peninsula. Diversity patterns for most microbial taxa in the

              inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical
              reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions
              (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying
              of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate
              for detection of differentially abundant species.
              Well-established statistical theory is available that
              simultaneously accounts for library size differences and
              biological variability using an appropriate mixture model.
              Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count
              data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are
              already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and
              DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and
              use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial
              improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over
              simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and
              rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests
              for species that are differentially abundant across sample
              classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also
              show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can
              be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further
              compare different Negative Binomial methods with a
              recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in
              a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq
              performs well when there is an adequate number of biological
              replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false
              positive rate. Based on these results and well-established
              statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid
              rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific

              Approximately 60\% to 25\% of the dissolved oil with or without

              first sequenced genomes of marine Bacteroidetes seemed to confirm
              this assumption. Many more genomes have been sequenced recently.
              Here, a comparative analysis of marine Bacteroidetes genomes
              revealed a life strategy different from those of other important
              phyla of marine bacterioplankton such as Cyanobacteria and

              attached to particles, have the capacity to degrade polymers,
              including a large number of peptidases, glycoside hydrolases
              (GHs), glycosyl transferases, adhesion proteins, as well as the

              genes are located in close association with genes for
              TonB-dependent receptors and transducers, suggesting an
              integrated regulation of adhesion and degradation of polymers.
              This confirmed the role of this abundant group of marine bacteria

              significantly larger number of proteases than GHs, while

              cobalamin because they have no cobalamin-dependent enzymes.
              Deficiencies are therefore common in strict vegetarians, and in
              the elderly, who are susceptible to an autoimmune disorder that
              prevents its efficient uptake. In contrast, many algae are rich
              in vitamin B12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis
              (Nori), containing as much cobalamin as liver. Despite this, the
              role of the cofactor in algal metabolism remains unknown, as does
              the source of the vitamin for these organisms. A survey of 326
              algal species revealed that 171 species require exogenous vitamin
              B12 for growth, implying that more than half of the algal kingdom
              are cobalamin auxotrophs. Here we show that the role of vitamin
              B12 in algal metabolism is primarily as a cofactor for vitamin
              B12-dependent methionine synthase, and that cobalamin auxotrophy
              has arisen numerous times throughout evolution, probably owing to
              the loss of the vitamin B12-independent form of the enzyme. The
              source of cobalamin seems to be bacteria, indicating an important
              and unsuspected symbiosis.},

              implicated in sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation, but also

              Here, we reconstructed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of a

              these interactions are difficult to study partly because the
              major photosynthetic organisms are microscopic, unicellular

@article{Whitman1998-sj,
	Abstract = {The number of prokaryotes and the total amount of their cellular
              carbon on earth are estimated to be 4-6 x 10(30) cells and
              350-550 Pg of C (1 Pg = 10(15) g), respectively. Thus, the total
              amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100\% of the estimated total
              carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global
              models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon
              stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth's prokaryotes
              contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of
              these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of
              these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth's
              prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and
              terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 x
              10(29), 2.6 x 10(29), 3.5 x 10(30), and 0. 25-2.5 x 10(30),
              respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the
              upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil
              are consistent with average turnover times of 6-25 days, 0.8 yr,
              and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of
              uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of
              prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1-2 x 10(3) yr.
              The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is
              estimated at 1.7 x 10(30) cells/yr and is highest in the open
              ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes
              provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity.},

	Abstract = {Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were
              published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically
              changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to
              completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and
              identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as
              well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard
              procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of
              bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the
              bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions
              to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has
              produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50
              different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla.
              However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla
              that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to
              improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized
              taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short
              palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with
              immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold.
              How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a
              large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial
              genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation
              sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few
              hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the
              entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is
              extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from
              50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla.
              Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the
              case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it
              is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of
              more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core
              genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000
              different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome
              sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as
              genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics,
              and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future,
              high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could
              revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding
              pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

              our current understanding of life's phylogenetic diversity.
              Phylogenetic comparison of gene sequences is a natural way to
              identify microorganisms and can also be used to infer the course
              of evolution. Three decades of molecular phylogenetic studies
              with various molecular markers have provided the outlines of a
              universal tree of life (ToL), the three-domain pattern of
              archaea, bacteria, and eucarya. The sequence-based perspective on
              microbial identification additionally opened the way to the
              identification of environmental microbes without the requirement
              for culture, particularly through analysis of rRNA gene
              sequences. Environmental rRNA sequences, which now far outnumber
              those from cultivars, expand our knowledge of the extent of
              microbial diversity and contribute increasingly heavily to the
              emerging ToL. Although the three-domain structure of the ToL is
              established, the deep phylogenetic structure of each of the
              domains remains murky and sometimes controversial. Obstacles to
              accurate inference of deep phylogenetic relationships are both
              systematic, in molecular phylogenetic calculations, and
              practical, due to a paucity of sequence representation for many

	Abstract = {There has been a recent explosion of research within the field of
              microbial ecology that has been fueled, in part, by
              methodological improvements that make it feasible to characterize
              microbial communities to an extent that was inconceivable only a
              few years ago. Furthermore, there is increasing recognition
              within the field of ecology that microorganisms play a critical
              role in the health of organisms and ecosystems. Despite these
              developments, an important gap still persists between the
              theoretical framework of macroecology and microbial ecology. We
              highlight two idiosyncrasies of microorganisms that are
              fundamental to understanding macroecological patterns and their
              mechanistic drivers. First, high dispersal rates provide novel
              opportunities to test the relative importance of niche,
              stochastic, and historical processes in structuring biological
              communities. Second, high speciation rates potentially lead to
              the convergence of ecological and evolutionary time scales. After
              reviewing these unique aspects, we discuss strategies for
              improving the conceptual integration of microbes into
              macroecology. As examples, we discuss the use of phylogenetic
              ecology as an integrative approach to explore patterns across the
              tree of life. Then we demonstrate how two general theories of
              biodiversity (i.e., the recently developed theory of stochastic
              geometry and the neutral theory) can be adapted to
              microorganisms. We demonstrate how conceptual models that
              integrate evolutionary and ecological mechanisms can contribute
              to the unification of microbial ecology and macroecology.},

	Abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001,
              there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The
              hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet
              controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically
              similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per
              capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to
              asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are
              the result of species similarities, rather than of species
              differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far
              one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological
              equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper,
              I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize
              ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the
              species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In
              this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of
              ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example
              evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of
              shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is
              simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I
              conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely
              to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich
              communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the
              case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and
              recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed
              dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to
              heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens
              and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the
              high species richness of the community strongly reduce the
              potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or
              nearly equivalent species.},

              revealed new taxa and previously unrecognized metabolic
              potential; however, our understanding of what regulates this
              diversity is limited. Using terminal restriction fragment length
              polymorphism (T-RFLP) data from bacterial small-subunit ribosomal
              RNA genes we show that, independent of depth and time, a large
              fraction of bacterioplankton co-occurrence patterns are
              non-random in the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre
              (NPSG). Pair-wise correlations of all identified operational
              taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed a high degree of significance,
              with 6.6\% of the pair-wise co-occurrences being negatively
              correlated and 20.7\% of them being positive. The most abundant
              OTUs, putatively identified as Prochlorococcus, SAR11, and SAR116
              bacteria, were among the most correlated OTUs. As expected,
              bacterial community composition lacked statistically significant
              patterns of seasonality in the mostly stratified water column
              except in a few depth horizons of the sunlit surface waters, with
              higher frequency variations in community structure apparently
              related to populations associated with the deep chlorophyll
              maximum. Communities were structured vertically into epipelagic,
              mesopelagic, and bathypelagic populations. Permutation-based
              statistical analyses of T-RFLP data and their corresponding

              affect ecosystem functions in the NPSG.},

              contrast between strong warming of the Antarctic Peninsula and
              slight cooling of the Antarctic continental interior in recent
              decades. This pattern of temperature change has been attributed
              to the increased strength of the circumpolar westerlies, largely
              in response to changes in stratospheric ozone. This picture,
              however, is substantially incomplete owing to the sparseness and
              short duration of the observations. Here we show that significant
              warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most
              of West Antarctica, an area of warming much larger than
              previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1 degrees C
              per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and
              spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East
              Antarctica, the continent-wide average near-surface temperature
              trend is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model
              reproduce the essential features of the spatial pattern and the
              long-term trend, and we suggest that neither can be attributed
              directly to increases in the strength of the westerlies. Instead,
              regional changes in atmospheric circulation and associated

	Abstract = {Polar regions have experienced significant warming in recent
              decades. Warming has been most pronounced across the Arctic Ocean
              Basin and along the Antarctic Peninsula, with significant
              decreases in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice. Rapid
              retreat of glaciers and disintegration of ice sheets have also
              been documented. The rate of warming is increasing and is
              predicted to continue well into the current century, with
              continued impacts on ice dynamics. Climate-mediated changes in
              ice dynamics are a concern as ice serves as primary habitat for
              marine organisms central to the food webs of these regions.
              Changes in the timing and extent of sea ice impose temporal
              asynchronies and spatial separations between energy requirements
              and food availability for many higher trophic levels. These
              mismatches lead to decreased reproductive success, lower
              abundances, and changes in distribution. In addition to these
              direct impacts of ice loss, climate-induced changes also
              facilitate indirect effects through changes in hydrography, which
              include introduction of species from lower latitudes and altered
              assemblages of primary producers. Here, we review recent changes
              and trends in ice dynamics and the responses of marine
              ecosystems. Specifically, we provide examples of ice-dependent
              organisms and associated species from the Arctic and Antarctic to
              illustrate the impacts of the temporal and spatial changes in ice
              dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The marine ecosystem of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)
              extends from the Bellingshausen Sea to the northern tip of the
              peninsula and from the mostly glaciated coast across the
              continental shelf to the shelf break in the west. The glacially
              sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and
              characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by
              channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the
              shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the
              continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique
              ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP
              shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other
              SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks
              of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia
              superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and
              interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The
              Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions
              on Earth, having experienced a 2 degrees C increase in the annual
              mean temperature and a 6 degrees C rise in the mean winter
              temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past
              decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6 degrees C warming of the
              upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing
              in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of
              the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once
              dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing
              multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem
              responses to the regional warming include increased heat
              transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines
              in icedependent Ad\'{e}lie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant
              gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and
              zooplankton community composition and changes in krill
              recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The
              climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the
              presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term
              research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of
              climate change and marine ecosystem response.},

	Abstract = {16S rDNA clone library analysis was used to identify bacterial
              biodiversity in a variety of sea-ice microbial communities
              (SIMCO). DNA was extracted from seven Antarctic sea-ice samples
              and one Arctic sea-ice sample and 16S rDNA PCR-amplified using
              universal and Archaea-specific primers. Recombinant 16S rDNA
              clones were obtained and dereplicated using restriction fragment
              length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). After RFLP analysis, 100
              distinct phylotypes (a unique clone or group of clones with
              sequence similarity of >0.98) were defined. From the clone
              libraries 16S rDNA sequences of bacterial and eukaryotic origin
              were detected, however Archaea were not detected either with
              universal or Archaea-specific 16S rDNA primer sets. Bacterial
              phylotypes grouped within the alpha and gamma proteobacteria, the
              Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides division, the Gram-Positive
              bacteria and the orders Chlamydiales and Verrucomicrobiales. The
              majority of bacterial phylotypes were affiliated with
              heterotrophic taxa and many grouped closely with cultivated
              genera and species. Eukaryotic clones were affiliated with a
              variety of autotrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton and
              included a large number of chloroplast 16S rDNA genes. The
              findings of this investigation corroborated culture data
              indicating bacterial biodiversity increased in SIMCO displaying
              high levels of primary production, however the bacterial
              communities within SIMCO were highly heterogeneous at the
              genus/species-level between different samples. A comparison of
              Antarctic and Arctic SIMCO revealed certain sea-ice dwelling
              bacterial genera are common at both poles.},

	Abstract = {Sea ice and oceanic boundaries have a dominant effect in
              structuring Antarctic marine ecosystems. Satellite imagery and
              historical data have identified the southern boundary of the
              Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a site of enhanced biological
              productivity. Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have
              related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and
              salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice
              extent. Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and
              oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline,
              linking the scales of local surveys and global observations.
              Between 80 degrees and 150 degrees E there is a threefold
              variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to
              examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on
              biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity,
              Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where
              winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located
              where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological
              activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it. We
              propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines
              both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological
              productivity at all trophic levels.},

              winter sea-ice has a profound influence. However, some effects
              are inconsistent between species and areas, some in opposite
              directions at different stages of breeding and life cycles, and
              others remain paradoxical. The combination of recent harvest
              driven changes and those caused by global warming may produce
              rapid shifts rather than gradual changes.},

	Abstract = {A numerical model shows that in Antarctic sea ice, increased
              flooding in regions with thick snow cover enhances primary
              production in the infiltration (surface) layer. Productivity in
              the freeboard (sea level) layer is also determined by sea ice
              porosity, which varies with temperature. Spatial and temporal
              variation in snow thickness and the proportion of first-year ice
              thus determine regional differences in sea ice primary
              production. Model results show that of the 40 teragrams of carbon
              produced annually in the Antarctic ice pack, 75 percent was
              associated with first-year ice and nearly 50 percent was produced
              in the Weddell Sea.},
