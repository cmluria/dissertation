\prefacesection{Abstract}
Oceans cover 70\% of the Earthâ€™s surface and each liter of seawater contains billions of microbes. These microbes account for most of the biomass in the oceans, driving biogeochemical cycles that govern marine food webs and the global carbon cycle. While recent advances in molecular biology have greatly increased our understanding of marine microbial assemblages, the ocean remains an undersampled and poorly understood environment. This is especially true of remote Antarctic waters where microbes reflect and influence strong seasonal, interannual and climate change-driven ecosystem variability. This research uses small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to examine microbial diversity across different temporal and spatial scales in the coastal waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), with a focus on phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a driver of bacterial activity and community structure. Research findings were interpreted using ecological theory, particularly community assembly rules. A survey of microbial diversity across all three domains of life revealed similar bacterial communities in winter surface waters and summer deep waters, habitats that share the common feature of reduced light and primary production. A fine-scale analysis of WAP bacterial succession during the winter-to-summer transition found increased bacterial production, decreased richness, and changes in community composition concurrent with a major phytoplankton bloom. Expanding this analysis to multiple years suggested that interannual variability in large-scale climatic forces may indirectly structure bacterial communities through phytoplankton dynamics. DOM amendments in the form of phytoplankton exudates altered bacterial production, abundance, and community composition in mesocosm experiments, demonstrating the significance of phytoplankton-derived carbon. Likewise, DOM-rich filtered sea ice amendments enhanced bacterial production. While most results emphasized the importance of environmental forcing and niche-based processes in community assembly, priority effects were evident, suggesting that interannual variability in the timing of phytoplankton blooms is critical to bacterial community responses. This research advances our understanding of the role of bacterial communities in the WAP and informs a growing body of ecological theory pertaining to microbes.

\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I owe so many thanks to the people who have helped me become a scientist and supported me each step of the way.
 
Thanks to:
 
â€¦ Jeremy Rich, my primary advisor over the years, was endlessly patient and always pushed me, sometimes to my frustration, to defend and define my work, making me a better scientists and resulting in a stronger project.
 
â€¦ Linda Amaral-Zettler, Hugh Ducklow, and Jeremy Rich were all principal investigators for one or more sections of this dissertation. Hugh introduced me to Antarctica and my thesis research was grounded in the valuable experience (and fond memories) that I gained working with Hugh and the Palmer LTER program. My work benefited from Lindaâ€™s careful oversight. Together, Linda, Jeremy, and Hugh conceived and led parts of this study and my work was made possible through their input and guidance.
 
â€¦ Casey Dunn graciously stepped in as my advisor a year ago and warmly welcomed me to his lab. Casey, along with EEB, ensured that I had the support and mentorship needed to complete my degree. Other faculty were impromptu mentors along the way, especially Sohini Ramachandran and Heather Leslie. I appreciate the work that EEB faculty and administrative staff do every day to foster learning and professional development. 
 
â€¦ Many others contributed to my work here in New England. Dan Repeta got me excited about phytoplankton exudates and generously gave his time and resources to get me started on that path. Andrew Rhyne helped me to grow and harvest hundreds of liters of diatoms, no easy task. Nuria Fernandez Gonzalez, Susan Huse, Annaliese Jones, Elizabeth McCliment, Leslie Murphy, and Naomi Shelton provided valuable laboratory and bioinformatics support.
 
â€¦ And many more contributed to my work in the field: Jamie Collins, Sharon Grim, Sarah Laperriere, Kristin Myers, Sean Oâ€™Neill, Monica Stegman, Stefanie Strebel, Natasja van Gestel, Sebastian Vivancos, Madelyne Willis, Kathleen Woods, and other members of B045 from before my time. Matthew Erickson taught me everything I know about flow cytometry and helped me through the logistics of multiple field seasons. The United States Antarctic Program, including the staff at Palmer Station and aboard the Lawrence M. Gould, especially Carolyn Lipke, enabled science to happen each and every day.
 
â€¦ My parents instilled in me curiosity and a love of education and allowed me the figurative freedom to pursue my own intellectual development. My siblings have been a source of unconditional love through this process. My in-laws sent blessings and encouragement every single week. Iâ€™m also so grateful to the family Iâ€™ve made here in Providence: Cat, Leila, Melinda, Michelle, Michael, Joanne, Justin, Rebecca, and Rosemary. Michelle, Iâ€™m so glad you responded to that first email. I am blessed to have such wonderful friends and my family is blessed to have such wonderful aunties, uncles, and grandparents.
 
â€¦ Last, but perhaps foremost, my husband, Nikhil Murgai. He has been endlessly supportive, going to the ends of the Earth (literally!) for my degree. From carboys to C++, I canâ€™t imagine this thesis without his contributions to my life and my research.
 
My work was supported by the following National Science Foundation grants: NSF DEB-0717390 and ANT-1142114 to Linda Amaral-Zettler, OPP-0217282, OPP-0823101, and PLR-1440435 to Hugh Ducklow, and ANT-1141993 to Jeremy Rich. In addition, my work benefited from a Brown Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Dissertation Improvement Grant and free computation resources through the AWS Educate program and the Github Student Developer Pack. I was generously supported by the Brown-MBL program, the Brown Graduate School, and the Brown Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
